### Who am I?

I’m Shankari, an embedded systems enthusiast who enjoys working at the intersection of hardware and low-level software. My main focus lies in developing firmware, writing drivers, and exploring the inner working of operating systems — especially Linux.

### What I Work On?

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:
- Linux kernel development and debugging.
- Writing Linux kernel drivers for custom hardware.
- Creating and modifying Device Tree files to enable platform support.
- Developing and debugging embedded firmware for MCUs like the BeagleConnect Freedom, ESP32, BeaglePlay, and Raspberry Pi
- Experimenting with things like real-time I/O, UART-to-DAC pipelines and system bring-up.

### Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog to share what I’ve learned — and what I’m still learning. Its kind of my digital lab notebook — a place where I share the things I build, fix, break (and fix again). Whether it's a deep dive into the Linux kernel or a weekend project with an ESP32, I document the how and why behind the process.

### Let’s Connect

I’m always open to collaborations, questions, or geeky conversations about embedded systems. Feel free to reach out — whether you're hacking on a board, contributing upstream, or just starting your journey.
